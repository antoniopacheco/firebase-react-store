This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a basic chat demo implemented using firebase-react-store. It requires a working Firebase
backend, or you can use the [firebase-server](https://github.com/urish/firebase-server) project
to provide the realtime database. If using firebase-server, first install then start the backend using:

```
    ./node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -p 5555
```

Otherwise, you'll need to modify the Firebase config object in database.js.

## Running the Demo

Install the project dependencies first with:

### `npm i`

Then run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
